# PYTHON BASICS: THE EXERCISES

## ABOUT:

(SVK) Kedze budem priklady pisat v mojom Python `IDE` (integrated development environment), je 
ovela lahsie pre mna pouzivat Anglictinu (ENG), tak sa nehambim a budem tak robit. 

(ENG) This repository will hold the Python exercises. 
In the exercises we will try to cover most of the Python basics and maybe in the future also some advanced topics.

## STRUCTURE:

The exercises are organized as follows:

1. For each Python basic topic (for example `functions`) we will have a folder in this repository. 
   For example, here we have folder `functions`, that should cover some basic examples for Python 
   functions.
   
2. Under particular folder you will always find a `README.md`. 
   The `README.md` holds all the assignments for the exercise.
   
3. The solutions, will be (at some point) uploaded to the sub-folder. For example for 
   topic `functions` we will put solutions into `../functions/solutions` sub-folder.
   
4. In the exercises we will start with simple problems (denoted by `*`), 
   then continue with medium (denoted by `**`) and finish with hard (`***`) problems.

5. I will try to keep number of problems for each exercise ~ 12.
   
## NOTES:

- Note, we will be extensively using the Python [type hinting](https://realpython.com/lessons/type-hinting/) 
  and Python [docstrings](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/documentation/#writing-docstrings). 
  So, if you are not very familiar with them, click on above links. The main reason is, that with the type 
  hints and docstrings the definitions of exercises is much easier. Also, the `type hinting` and `docstrings`
  are a **good coding practices**, so we will be doing it from the very beginning.
